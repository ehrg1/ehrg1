# üëã Hi, I'm Rayan Saad

## üéì About Me
I'm a **Computer Science student** with a passion for **app development** and a drive to build innovative solutions. I enjoy the challenge of turning ideas into functional applications that can make a difference. My journey in technology started with learning the fundamentals of programming and has expanded to creating software across various platforms, including mobile, web, and desktop.

I am proficient in a wide range of languages and frameworks, including **Assembly**, **C**, **C++**, **Java**, **Python**, **Dart**, **Flutter**, **JavaScript**, **React Native**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. I love exploring new technologies and am always eager to learn more, especially in the fields of app development and software engineering.

Beyond programming, I enjoy working on projects that integrate **problem-solving** with practical implementation. I am also passionate about **collaborating with others** and believe that great software comes from diverse ideas and teamwork. Whether it's a small feature or a large-scale system, I strive to write clean, efficient code and approach challenges with a growth mindset.

I'm also interested in exploring areas such as **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **machine learning** to deepen my understanding of computer science and continue evolving as a developer.
